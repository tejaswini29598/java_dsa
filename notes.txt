Minimum one branch is created when we create a repository
steps and commands:
place a document file in the java_dsa folder
here i placed Notes.txt
1. ask the git to list down all the files that nedd to be pushed(uploaded)

$git add path
$git add C:/learning/java_dsa
$git add .

2. push (upload)
$ git push origin main
$ git push (Always pushes to main branch)

3. Ask the git to create a secured object in which all the files to pushed are copied
$git commit -m "java dsa notes added"

To check the status of the repository
$ git status

now open the java_dsa in vs code

To create project in eclipse:
file -> new -> project -> java Project
in the dialogue box (new window)
de-select the module.java check box
enter the project name(practice) and click finish

now in explorer, expand the project folder
now right click  src folder -> create -> new -> package
give the package name "day1"

right click  "day1" in explorer (under src folder), create -> class
class name "HelloWorld" 

Primitives types in java
    Numeric:
	  number only
		byte
		short
		int 
		long
	  number with precision/ accuracy
	  float
	  double
	Char
    Boolean	
ARITHMETIC OPERATORS:
+ - * / %

// 11/06/25 //

All the operators take 2 operands/inputs
Hence, All are binary operators
The expression is written using "INFIX" notation
55 + 5
inputs are numbers
output is also a number
5+8/9 The division must be evaluated first because of the BODMAS rule
All arithmetic operators hava left to right associtivity
The "INFIX" expression is what we uses but it will be first converted to "POSTFIX" expression and only then it will get evaluated

int num=45;
00000000 00000000 00000000 00101101 //It is decimal to binary conversion how the 45 number is stored in memory

int num= -45;
00101101 // it is the binary value of the 45
11010010 // 1's compliment
11010011 // 2's compliment
now -1 * 2(7) + 1* 2(6) + 1 * 2(4) + 3
-128+64+16+3
-64+19
-45

float num = 5.5; // it is considered as double
therefore float num =5.5f; // considered as float

C++ inherited C

sum = 5 + 5.5;
when the expression has different types of values , then the lower type value will be changed to higher type
this is because the data must not be lost
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Relational Operators:
> < >= <= != == 
input has numbers
output is Boolean
All are binary operators
used with infix notation
has lesser precedence than arithmetic operators
has higher precedence than logical operators

for i from 1 to n do:
for(int i=1;i<=n;i++)
  or for(int i=1;i<n+1;i++)

(10,40) //closed interval from 10 to 40
(20,30) //open interval from 21 to 29
(35,65) //right open interval from 35 to 64

//assembly language is stored in .esm

i=10;
j=5;
i++; j--;
a[i] =b[j];
b[j]--;

i=10;
j=5;
a[++i] =b[--j]--;
---------------------------------------------------------

logical operators
& &&  | || !
input has boolean 
output is Boolean
All are binary operators except !
used with infix notation
has lesser precedence than arithmetic operators and relational operators
has higher precedence than assignment operators

All the programming files are stored in secondary memory(disk)
files are loaded using "MACROS"(preprocessive directives (#include))
.(dot operator) //left to right associtivity
object.field 
--------------------------------------------------------
java program structure  SUN Microsystems (Standford University Network Microsystems)
oops: abstraction,polymorphism,inheritance,encapsulation
Disadvantages of C++:-
1.main() must be global function
2.global functions were allowed, thus the solutions(apps,software) created with neither procedural or object oriented
3.global variables are still allowed in C++
4.files are loaded using macros and stored till end of the program
5.pointers are always a mess to many programmers
6.The onus(responsibility) of creating and deleting objects in the heap is on programmer
7.the inheritance is by default private which makes the accessing the inherited properties is very difficult. In java it is public inheritance
8.Multiple inheritance creates a solution which is low cohensive
9.The operator overloading concept can be used to just Implementanything which is necessary
10.The compiler created object file which is environment(OS) restircted/dependent/specific.
11.Handling run time errors is difficult
12.objects can be created in stach area as well

In java:(The Disadvantages of C++ have the solution in Java)
1.No global functions, All are only methods (methods vs functions)
Strict object oriented solution.Therefore no concept of global variables
2.signed and unsigned removed thus the primitive datatypes are simplified.
3.libraries can be loaded and used dynamically(no pre process)
4.pointers are abstracted and users are given references.
5.All objects are created in heap only
6.array is an object in java
7.creating object is the only job the programmer does. object deletion is automated with the concept of GARBAGE COLLECTION.
8.the inheritance is by default public thus doesnot make implementation very easy
9.no multiple inheritance
10.all classes are always high cohensive
11.the only operator can be overloaded is + and only for string concatenation
12.The complier creates a byte code which is environment(OS) independent
13.handling runtime errors is easy via exception handling
14.friend concept is removed thus no more ambiguity and complexity in classes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Different stages of a program
C++ is fast than java during runtime and python is the slowest among all
The code area has the bytecode i.e .class files
static/class vars are stored in GDS
local vars and function parameters ,return address and method address(linkage) are stored in stack area
all objects are stored in heap(dynamically allocated memory)
The creation of objects are done only in runtime and the memory allocation is done also in runtime(dynamic runtime or memory allocation) and in compile time it thinks can i allocate the memory
