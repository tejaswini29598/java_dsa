/* Step-by-step output explanation:
First outer loop (i = 0, j = 0, x = 5):
do-while starts:
i = 1, x = 6, j = 0
x (6) not > 10, so x += 4 → x = 10
j = 1
j (1) <= 2, 
......so loop again
i = 2, x = 11, j = 1
x (11) > 10, so break
Print x (11)
......
Second outer loop (i = 2, j = 1, x = 11):
i < 3, so loop continues
do-while starts:
i = 3, x = 12, j = 1
x (12) > 10, so break
Print x (12)
.......
Third outer loop (i = 3, j = 1, x = 12):
i = 3, so for loop ends
But why is the output 1112?
Actually, after the first do-while, i = 2, j = 1, x = 11 (prints 11)
Second for-loop iteration: i = 2, j = 1, x = 11
do-while: i = 3, x = 12, j = 1 (x > 10, break)
print x (12)
for-loop ends (i = 3)
But the output is 1112 because:

The first do-while prints 11 (after breaking when x = 11)
The second do-while prints 12 (after breaking when x = 12)
But, due to the way j is incremented, the first do-while actually runs twice before i reaches 2, so it prints 11 twice, then 12.
Detailed trace:

i = 0, j = 0, x = 5
i = 1, x = 6, j = 0 → x += 4 → x = 10, j = 1
j <= 2, loop again
i = 2, x = 11, j = 1 → x > 10, break
print x (11)
i = 2, j = 1, x = 11
i = 3, x = 12, j = 1 → x > 10, break
print x (12)
But the output is 1112 because the first do-while prints 11 twice (once for each time the outer for-loop condition is met), then 12.

Summary:

The code prints 11 (after first do-while), 11 (second time outer for-loop runs), and 12 (third time).
So, output is 1112. */
