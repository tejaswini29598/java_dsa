1. write a program to convert an infix expression to postfix expression and viceversa
2. write a program to evaluate postfix expression
3. Implement the algorithm how the floating algorithms stored in memory
4. which are the two relational operators using which all other relational operators can be implemented?

5.which operator has lesser precedence than assignment operators
The post increment and post decrement operators have lesser precedence than the assignment operators
6. which operator has higher precedence than arithmetic operators
paranthesis operator. Actually it is not the operator but it is used to override the precedence of the operators
7.drawback of procedural language
8.drawback of oops
9.methods vs functions in java
10.why OS has the authority to allocate memory?
11.applications vs software vs program?
12.Bytes of datatypes
13.public static void main(String[] args)?
14.Multiprogramming vs Mutilprocessing?
15.Dynamic vs static memory allocation?
16.evalution of programming languages?
17.Memory allocation in C++ and java?
18.java naming standards,function overloading and overriding ,cases of writinig the code(pascal,snake,camel)
19.instance variables vs class variabales
20.permutations vs combinations
21.prolog in functions,apilog,business class 
22.pojo class (play old java object) 
23.jvm and jdk
24.why super keyword is the first statement?
constructor call should be first in the constructor
25.this keyword
for reference,to access overloaded constructor of the same class,to differentiate the names of function parameters and instances
26.void ,static methods
27.object vs reference
28.cohesion and coupling
1.find sum of the series 1-n+n2-n3...n terms 0<=n<=9 ,1 <=m<=25
2.find sum of odd digits of a number
2345=8(3+5)
3.find sum of even placed digits of a number
9128735=12(1+8+3)
91827364=10(1+2+3+4)
4.second largest and second smallest
consider an array of 5 elements for example, 4 5 3 2 1
here the second largest will be 4 and second smallest will be 2
sort the elements by Arrays.sort(); now it will become 1 2 3 4 5
consider for loop to make iterations
in for loop do the iterations upto n elements or n-1

5. Find sum of Odd placed Even Digits in a number. 
Note: You can make other 3 combinations for the above program.
6. Find smallest/biggest digit in a number.
7. Find sum of 1st and last digits in a number.
8. Find nth placed digit in a number
9. Count number of Prime digits in a number
10. Count number of composite digits in a number.
