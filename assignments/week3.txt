..The goal is to move all the disks from one rod to another, following specific rules: 
...only one disk can be moved at a time,
... a larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk, 
...and only the top disk on a stack can be moved.
The minimum number of moves required to solve the puzzle with n disks is 2n - 1. 
for n=4 we have 2^4 - 1 = 15 moves.

2.Difference between recursion and iteration and backtracking?
3.why scanner.nextLine(); is added before declaration of string like this  Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        List<Integer> arr = new ArrayList<>();
        scanner.nextLine();
        String secondLine =scanner.nextLine();
// This is done to consume the newline character left in the input buffer after reading an integer with nextInt().
// If we don't do this, the next call to nextLine() will read an empty string
// because it encounters the leftover newline character from the previous input.
int n = scanner.nextInt();   // reads number, leaves \n
scanner.nextLine();          // consumes the leftover newline
String secondLine = scanner.nextLine();  // now reads the actual line

input: 
5
10 20 30 40 50
output:
line = ""   // oops! it's just the leftover \n
10 20 30 40 50

int n = scanner.nextInt();
scanner.nextLine();  // flush the newline
String line = scanner.nextLine();  // correctly reads "10 20 30 40 50"
// This ensures that the nextLine() call works as expected and captures the intended input.
