..The goal is to move all the disks from one rod to another, following specific rules: 
...only one disk can be moved at a time,
... a larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk, 
...and only the top disk on a stack can be moved.
The minimum number of moves required to solve the puzzle with n disks is 2n - 1. 
for n=4 we have 2^4 - 1 = 15 moves.

2.Difference between recursion and iteration and backtracking?
3.why scanner.nextLine(); is added before declaration of string like this  Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        List<Integer> arr = new ArrayList<>();
        scanner.nextLine();
        String secondLine =scanner.nextLine();
// This is done to consume the newline character left in the input buffer after reading an integer with nextInt().
// If we don't do this, the next call to nextLine() will read an empty string
// because it encounters the leftover newline character from the previous input.
int n = scanner.nextInt();   // reads number, leaves \n
scanner.nextLine();          // consumes the leftover newline
String secondLine = scanner.nextLine();  // now reads the actual line

input: 
5
10 20 30 40 50
output:
line = ""   // oops! it's just the leftover \n
10 20 30 40 50

int n = scanner.nextInt();
scanner.nextLine();  // flush the newline
String line = scanner.nextLine();  // correctly reads "10 20 30 40 50"
// This ensures that the nextLine() call works as expected and captures the intended input.

hashtables and hashmaps

dynamic programming 
....Guarantees an optimal solution if the problem exhibits the principle of optimality.
....May involve backtracking
...Reuses solutions to overlapping subproblems.
Some popular problems solved using Dynamic Programming are Fibonacci Numbers, Diff Utility (Longest Common Subsequence), Bellman–Ford Shortest Path, Floyd Warshall, Edit Distance and Matrix Chain Multiplication.

 greedy programming
 ...no backtracking
 ...May not always provide an optimal solution.
 Examples of popular algorithms where Greedy gives the best solution are Fractional Knapsack, Dijkstra's algorithm, Kruskal's algorithm, Huffman coding and Prim's Algorithm
