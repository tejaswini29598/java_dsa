Retail Shopping Application with Enhanced Rules.

You are tasked with developing a retail shopping application for generating itemized invoices, applying business rules for discounts, surcharges, and quantities, and providing a seamless customer experience.

The application unfolds across levels, each introducing new functionality, culminating in a complete solution that includes invoice generation and a breakdown of purchases.

Levels:
Level 1: Basic Item Entry and Total Calculation
Objective: Allow the user to input item details (code, description, quantity, price) and calculate the total cost for the item.

Key Steps:
1. Accept item code, description, quantity, and price.
2. Compute the total for a single item.
3. Display the total for the item.

Level 2: Iterative Item Entry and Grand Total
Objective: Enable multiple items to be added iteratively, and compute the grand total for all items.

Key Steps:
1. Use a loop to accept details for multiple items.
2. Compute the grand total by summing individual totals.
3. Display the grand total after all items have been entered.

Level 3: Applying Discounts and Surcharges
Objective: Introduce business rules for modifying the grand total based on conditions.

Rules Implemented:
1. Discount: If the grand total exceeds ₹10,000, apply a 10% discount.
2. Surcharge: If the grand total is less than ₹1,000 and payment is by card, apply a 2.5%
surcharge.
3. Quantity Discount: If the total quantity exceeds 20, apply an additional 5% discount on the
grand total (after other discounts).

Key Steps:
1. Check conditions for discounts and surcharges.
2. Adjust the grand total accordingly.
3. Display the modified total with adjustments explained.

Level 4: Membership Discounts
Objective: Introduce a membership system where customers get an additional discount.

Rules Implemented:
1. If the customer is a member (choice: 'y'), apply an additional 2% discount on the grand total
after all other adjustments.

Key Steps:
1. Prompt the user for membership status.
2. Apply the membership discount if applicable.
3. Update and display the final grand total.
